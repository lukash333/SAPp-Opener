This is simple input application, especially for SAP users.
Depends on the input lenght, user can open SAP system:
  - system ID : e.g. "S1P"
  - language + system ID: e.g. "enS1P"
  - language + system ID + client: e.g. "enS1P100"

Additional commands are also avaliable and you can add them in config.ini file
For now running exe apps is supported and webpages.
